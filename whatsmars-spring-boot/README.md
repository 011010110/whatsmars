# Spring Boot
👻 [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io)

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.
Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.
